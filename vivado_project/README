MPSOC_axidma is a axi dma example,
it has a axi stream loopback datapath.
To insert our own hls core, we just need to replace the axi-steam fifo with our own IP core.

To use the axi dma driver in the linux user level, please first login to the ubuntu on MPSOC.
then the example could be find in "~/xilinx_axidma/examples"
